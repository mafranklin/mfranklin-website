## Who am I and what is this?

My name is Matt Franklin (if you hadn't guessed). I created this site as something to do over lockdown 2.0 in early 2021. It is more of a personal project than anything else, but I hope to use it to experiment with web development and share some other projects I have been working on with anyone who will listen.

This will be an eclectic mix of stories and activities which have caught my interest. Some of the ideas I have for topics include the outdoors and hiking, genealogy and technical home projects.

So, now for a bit about me. I am currently working for [Carbon Co-op](https://carbon.coop) a Manchester based co-operative supporting communities to make the radical reductions in home carbon emissions to avoid runaway climate change. In this role I am responsible for membership development as well as some projects in the energy services field (check out our great smart meter service). 

Before Carbon Co-op and the post-covid world I was leading the European communications for the [#BreakFreeFromPlastic](https://breakfreefromplastic.org) movement of thousands of grassroots groups and individuals working for a future free from plastic pollution. In this role I met with grassroots organisers and around the world, seeing first hand the impacts of plastic pollution on people's lives and livelihoods.

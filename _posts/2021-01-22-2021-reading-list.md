I will keep this post as a personal log of what I am reading and have read in 2021. As a target I hope to read a book every two weeks, so we will see how that goes.

## Reading

* [I Want to Believe: Posadism, UFOs and Apocalypse Communism - A. M. Gittlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed)

## Read

* ~~[The Dispossesed - Ursula K. Le Guin](https://www.plutobooks.com/9781786806208/i-want-to-believe/)~~

My list of books read this year is currently empty! Time to change that.

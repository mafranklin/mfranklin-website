I will keep this post as a personal log of what I am reading and have read in 2021. As a target I hope to read a book every two weeks, so we will see how that goes.

## Reading

* [2312 - Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2312_(novel))

## Read

* ~~[The Dispossesed - Ursula K. Le Guin](https://www.plutobooks.com/9781786806208/i-want-to-believe/)~~ (27/02/2021)

  *I clearly should have read this much sooner. This story of a physicist's journey from an anarchist colony moon to the capitalist homeworld has an amazing ethnographic quality. Two world systems beautifully constructed, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the future and utopianism - although it is likely that I am the last person I know to read it!*
* ~~[I Want to Believe: Posadism, UFOs and Apocalypse Communism - A. M. Gittlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed)~~ (03/02/2021)
  
  *A close study of Posadism's transition from a small Latin American trotskyist sect rooted in proletarian organising to an authoritarian cult of personality and finally into neo-Posadism, the 'memefied' and radically optimist vision of catastrophe communism and a post-terrestrial future. This book provides a glimpse beyond Posadism as a meme, showing the sometimes insightful political underpinnings and positivity as well as a cautionary tail for revolutionary socialists worldwide. I particularly enjoyed the reference to a Birmingham comrade's Trot Wars board game*

I will keep this post as a personal log of what I am reading and have read in 2021. As a target I hope to read a book every two weeks, so we will see how that goes.

## Reading

* [I Want to Believe: Posadism, UFOs and Apocalypse Communism - A. M. Gittlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed)

## Read

* ~~[The Dispossesed - Ursula K. Le Guin](https://www.plutobooks.com/9781786806208/i-want-to-believe/)~~ (27/02/2021)

  *I clearly should have read this much sooner. This story of a physist's journey from an anarchist colony moon to the capitalist homeworld has an amazing ethnographic quality. Two world systems beautifully constructed, I would highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in the future and utopianism - although it is likely that I am the last person I know to read it!*
